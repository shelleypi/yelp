# Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews
In this project, we'll develop a Sentiment Analysis model to predict if a review is positive or negative. Sentiment analysis is a field within Natural Language Processing (NLP) concerned with identifying and classifying subjective opinions from text. Sentiment analysis ranges from detecting emotions (happiness, anger, etc.) to intent (opinions, complaints, feedbacks, etc.). In its simplest form, sentiment analysis assigns a polarity (positive, negative, neutral) to a piece of text. 

The goals of this project are:
1. to assess the public perception of restaurants on Yelp through exploratory data analysis
2. to build a Sentiment Analysis model that accurately predicts the sentiment of reviews
3. to apply the model to a specific restaurant in order to reveal its key aspects that drive overall customer perception

You can download the data from [Yelp's Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset).

### Summary of Results
Our best model was <b>Logistic Regression</b> with a <b>balanced accuracy score of 0.95284</b>. We chose balanced accuracy score as our evaluation metric, since our dataset was imbalanced and both classes are equally important to us.
